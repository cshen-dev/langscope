title: ':cloud: Seven widely supported programming languages by cloud platforms'
---

Coming with the rise of microservices, there tends to be more than one language that is used within one organisation. The best-suited programming language is chosen for their domains. To meet this requirement, large cloud service providers like AWS/GCP/Azure offer a variety of SDK to ease developers' work and retain their customers. 

However, not all languages have their official SDK so I did some dig and list some safe choices if you want a shortcut.

Choose between them for application development with AWS / GCP / Azure 

Four Script Languages:
1. Javascript
2. Python  
3. PHP
4. Ruby

Three Serious Languages:
1. Java
2. C#
3. Go
