With the rise of microservices, organizations are increasingly using multiple programming languages. The best language for a particular microservice is chosen based on its specific domain. To meet this need, large cloud service providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure offer a variety of SDKs for different programming languages. This makes it easier for developers to build and maintain microservices on these platforms.

However, not all programming languages have official SDKs for all three cloud providers. To make it easier for developers to choose a language, I have compiled a list of safe choices for application development with AWS, GCP, or Azure.

- Javascript
- Python  
- PHP
- Ruby

**3** serious languages:
- Java
- C#
- Go
